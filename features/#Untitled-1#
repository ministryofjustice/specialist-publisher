These feature integration tests cover the same core scenarios that have
been tested for other finders, such as the AAIB report finder.

The scenarios cover creating and editing, publishing, withdrawing an
Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber) decision, and adding
and replacing attachments to a decision.

It was easiest to add these in a single commit, as they were developed at
the same time based on a copy of the features for asylum support tribunal
decisions.
